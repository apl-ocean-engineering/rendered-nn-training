# rendered-nn-training

This project aims to generate a synthetic training set of artificially rendered images to feed to a neural network that can then be used to identify real-world camera images. It uses the Panda3D package for Python to render a 3D model of the target object in a variety of positions and orientations in a realistic environment.

Uses Panda release 1.10.x and Python 2.7
